//TODO My new thinking!
// Load the DB first since that flows better from running an image. But that also
// means I need to also move template to right after running an image.
// Templates should also have a short section discussing how to make a template (using the export)
// Need a wrap up section that summarizes how great it is to develop on OpenShift
// They are overwhelmed by the end of the day and need to wrap it up in a nice way
