=== Welcome

Greetings and welcome to tutorial for using the all-in-one VM  (A1VM). By the time you have finished this tutorial
you will have gotten your hands nice and dirty playing with OpenShift. Our overall goals for this document is:

1. Introduce you to running applications in containers
2. Give you enough information to launch into learning more OpenShift

=== FYI

* You can keep using this VM to play with
    1. Docker
    2. Kubernetes
    3. OpenShift
    4. PostgreSQL with some advanced features
* This VM is not for production use and is community supported. You can go to the following places for more help
    1. StackOverflow and tag with OpenShift
    2. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/openshift[The Google Group ]
    3. The #openshift or #openshift-dev channels on freenode IRC
