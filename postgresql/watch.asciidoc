== crunchy-watch

The crunchy-watch container does a health check on a Postgres
master container and will trigger a failover onto a replica
container if the master can not be reached.

As part of the failover sequence, the replica chosen as the new
master will have its Openshift labels updated to become the 
new master.

=== Starting the container
The watch pod is  created as part of the tutorial startup script.

=== Accessing the Watch Container

You can view the log of the watch container to see if it has 
triggered a failover.

=== Testing 

You can delete the *pgmaster* pod to cause a failover to occur.  After
the failover, a new replica will be created by Openshift and the
replica chosen as the master have its labels updated.

Any applications using the master might see an error as the failover
proceeds but normal querying should pick back up quickly.
