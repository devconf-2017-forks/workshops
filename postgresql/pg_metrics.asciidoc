== Postgresql Metrics

Sometimes when you are running your database you want to collect and visualize metrics on the instance. Now we are going to set up infrastructure to collect and visualize the data. We already added a container to the master pod called pgcollect. The pgcollect container collects 30+ metrics and sends them to the Prometheus time series data store. From there we hook up the grafana visualization tools so we can look at the metrics.

=== The Components and Installing Them

We are about to add the following pieces to our application::
 * prometheus (pod and service)
 * prometheus push gateway (pod and service)
 * grafana (pod, service, and route)

Again, there is a template to add all the pieces we need:

[source, bash]
----

> oc new-app .\metrics.json -p CCP_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-9.5-1.2.2

----

You can access grafana web application by browsing the following URL:

http://grafana-spatialapp.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io/


Which is also available as a route to click on.


The default admininstrative user ID is *admin*.  The password is *admin*.

=== Creating a Datasource

In the upper left-side of the application, click on the dropdown
and select the Data Sources button to add a new data source.

Click on the Add Data Source button on the next screen.

Select *Prometheus* for the data source Type, enter a name of *crunchy*
for the Name field, enter http://prometheus-spatialapp.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io for the URL field
and click the Add button. Click the "test connection" button and you should get a green box to show up saying success. Then you can click save. If not then please call one of us over to help troubleshoot.

In the upper left-side of the application, click on the dropdown and select the Dashboard->New button to add a new dashboard.

On the next screen, click on the small green tab button in the upper left of the screen, select Add Panel->Graph to add a graph.

On the graph, select the *crunchy* data source on the bottom right of the screen.

Finally click on the Metric Lookup field to see the available metrics being collected.  Select a metric and it should display on the graph.

Don't expect to see any data right away. You need to go exercise the database to get metrics to show up. You can do this by doing a bunch of work using our web application. You could also load up the DDL file a couple of times.

The master container has pgbench in the image so we can use that as well.

[source, bash]
----

# instead of this command you can use the terminal in web console for the master pod
oc exec -it master bash -c pg

export PGHOST=/tmp;psql -c 'create database pgbench'
	/usr/pgsql-9.5/bin/pgbench --host=master --username=postgres --scale=5 --initialize pgbench
	/usr/pgsql-9.5/bin/pgbench --host=master --username=postgres --time=10 --client=15 pgbench
