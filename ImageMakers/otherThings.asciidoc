== Other Things You Should Know
Let's touch briefly on some of the ways you can allow users to alter settings (such as passwords or memory settings) in your Docker images. The primary way to do this is by using environment variables in your docker image for settings. Once you put these into your Docker image the user can set these in OpenShift using OpenShift https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/environment_variables.html[environment variables], https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/configmaps.html[ConfigMaps], or https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/secrets.html[Secrets]. All three of these things are better means to handle setting information in your app that you might want to change at runtime.

Let's look at the Red Hat Software Collections Library's PostgreSQL docker image to see some examples of how to work with environment variables in your Docker image.

https://github.com/sclorg/postgresql-container/tree/master/9.5/root/usr/share/container-scripts/postgresql

Once you set up your image to accept these, the end user can use OpenShift environment variables, secrets, or configmaps to set these variables. Again, you may also want to put them into a template with sensible defaults but allow the user to overide the auto-generated or default values.

=== You Need to Brush Up On Shell Scripting

I hope it comes as no surprise to anyone that the simple Docker image we built for Apache HTTPD would not be realistic in a production scenario. Most of the production ready images I have seen launch their software using a shell script which in turn may call other shell scripts. You will most likely need to make these same kinds of shell scripts to accomplish any real world Docker images.

For example, here is the repository for CrunchyDB Docker containers, production ready PostgreSQL containers. They are probably our most advanced partner in making containers to run on OpenShift and Kubernetes.

https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers

So we start with this file, which is the Dockerfile for RHEL 7:

https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/rhel7/9.5/Dockerfile.postgres.rhel7

Which then calls this file:

https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/bin/postgres/start.sh

Which then calls this file - which allows the user to set shared buffers and such:

https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/bin/postgres/start-pg-wrapper.sh

which has lines that do sed on a temporary postgresql.conf

https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/bin/postgres/start-pg-wrapper.sh#L94

Here is the postgresql.conf.template it is using

https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/conf/postgres/postgresql.conf.template#L114
