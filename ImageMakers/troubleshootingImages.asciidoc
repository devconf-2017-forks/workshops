== Troubleshooting images

The `oc debug` command makes it easy to obtain shell access in a misbehaving pod. It clones the exact environment of the running deployment configuration, replication controller, or pod, but replaces the run command with a shell.

So you would use it like:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc debug dc/MyDeploymentConfig

or

$ oc debug mypod
----

This will deploy or run the pod, but instead of doing the run command at the end of the Dockerfile, it will just give you a bash prompt so you can poke around and see how things are set up.
